In the name of Allah, the most merciful.

In the high-tech century we live in, it becomes a necessity to gain knowledge about computer technology.  As a matter of fact, our daily lives have been affected by this technology unimaginably. We communicate & serve through it. And social media is one of the most powerful platforms of the technology.  Hence for a person who is truly trying to deliver a message related to the daily lives of a man definitely needs to learn this methodology.

However, Dawah<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a> is an obligation, and every muslim is bound to give dawah either by words or their actions. For a da’ee<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a> this technological advancement could be a really helpful gadget for successful dawah.

***reach out more people at the same time.**

According to statista.com, there are approximately 2.46 billion people using different platforms of social media worldwide. Apparently this means that a daee could easily reach out almost half of the world population through media. So to reach more people at the same time effectively, social media could be the number one source.

***regularity**

Checking the social media updates have been one of the first things people do now after waking up. They regularly check their posts and spend a lot of time on it. Socialmedia.com says teens spent almost nine hours a day on social media. So when da’ees use this technology and give dawah through that medium, more people will be reached on a regular basis.

***people prefer social media over booklets and gatherings**

There are many active daees on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube etc.  Some of those are muftis, and religious scholars.  And others are highly followed da’ees. They share religious information, personal views and healthy discussions on topics related to Islam on those.  Without a doubt, Social media attracts more people than booklets or books. People can more conveniently use their smart phones, tablets or iPads and be open to dawah.  So for a da’ee the invitation to the religion via a more sophisticated way would for sure, be more fruitful.

***people are more open on media.** 

As reported in a research done in 2014, by Pew Research Centre, 20% of the American population shares their religious faith on facebook and twitter. Furthermore, the Quran states,**_“Invite to the path of your Lord with wisdom and good advice_.” **( Quran [An-Nahl ](http://www.learning-quran.com/quran-translations/german-translation/recitation-of-surat-an-nahl-2/)16:125).<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a> A da’ee needs to know what does the recipient of dawah believes in and the level of faith in that person. For example the presence of a God is most important to talk about with an atheist, but the Oneness of Allah is more appropriate when preaching a Christian or a Jew. Clearly for a preacher, who is active on facebook or twitter could easily track down people’s belief, making it easier to connect with them and present Islam with wisdom.

***to be up-to date**

Even though it’s truly the most peaceful religion, Islam is the most accused religion of all, of terrorism, strict rules and inhumane laws. So a daee needs to be aware of all the accusations and who does that. Those hate crimes against Islam is not only perpetrated in person, but mostly on social media. There are so many fake sites in the name of Islam, to make the ignorant hate Islam. And so many people misinterpret the rulings like that of _qisas<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><strong>[iv]</strong></a>_ or _niqab<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><strong>[v]</strong></a>_. Hence to clarify the doubts people would have regarding the religion, it’s very important for people who give dawah to be familiar with the technology.

In conclusion, the above mentioned explanations prove that computer technology and social media is essential for da’ees.

Jazakallah khairan
