Praise be to Allah.

And may His blessings be upon His messenger and chosen prophet.

Monotheism or Tawheed is the main fundamental pillar of Islam. Allah ta’laa says about it in the Quran as “And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [Quran Az-Zariyat 51:56]

Tawheed is categorized in to three main categories.

It may be defined as follows: Believing that Allah is One with no partner or associate in His Lordship (ruboobiyyah)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, divinity (uloohiyyah)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> or names and attributes (al-asma’ wa’l-sifaat)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.

It is the message which all the prophets of Allah came with. The gateway to the eternal joy of jannah with the love of Allah ta’aala. _“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Tâghût (all false deities, i.e. do not worship anything besides Allah).’” [Al Qur’an 16:36]._ 

Moreover, _Prophet_ Muhammad (ﷺ) spent 13 years in Mecca, calling out people for tawheed only, which shows the true importance of it in Islam. A person does not become a muslim unless he believes in tawheed or oneness of Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) used to say, &#8220;I seek refuge (with YOU) by Your &#8216;Izzat, None has the right to be worshiped but You Who does not die while the Jinns and the human beings die.&#8221;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>

Without a doubt, tawheed is the basic of knowledge which a Muslim should attain firstly to be able to be on the correct belief. Here are some reasons why it is so essential.

  1. **To be safe from Allah’s Wrath on Day of Judgment.** 

Allah ta’aalaa says in the Noble Quran, _&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers.&#8221;_ [Quran Al-Maidha 5:72]

So if someone does not acquire the knowledge that Allah is to be worshipped alone, he would end up in hell eventually. Clearly, to be able to worship Him, one needs to know the attributes of Him and how exactly He has to be worshiped.

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <strong>Tawheed can ensure success in this life and hereafter. </strong>
  </li>
</ol>

A person with firm belief and the knowledge of tawheed shall live by success in this life and the hereafter. Allah affirms this in the Quran by saying _“He (Allah) said: ‘Get you down (from Paradise to the earth), both of you together, some of you are an enemy to some others. Then if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance he shall neither go astray nor shall be distressed. But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Qur’an nor acts on its teachings), verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection.’” [Al Qur’an 20:123-124]_

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <strong>Sincerity of actions.</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Having the knowledge of Allah’s names and attributes makes a person love Him or fear Him, with sincere actions. It improves one’s faith too. Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Believing in and knowing the Most Beautiful Names of Allaah includes the three types of Tawheed: Tawheed al-Ruboobiyyah (Unity of Divine Lordship), Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Unity of the Divine Nature) and Tawheed al-Asma’ wa’l-Sifaat (Unity of the Divine Names and Attributes). These three types of Tawheed form the essence and joy of faith (the word translated here as “joy” implies peace and relief from stress), and this knowledge is the basis and purpose of faith. The more a person learns about the Names and Attributes of Allaah, the more his faith increases and the stronger his conviction becomes.”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <strong>Allah loves those who call them by His best names.</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

The Prophet (ﷺ) sent (an army unit) under the command of a man who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the Sura 112): &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;He is Allah, the One. &#8221; (112.1) When they returned (from the battle), they stated that to the Prophet. He said (to them), &#8220;Ask him why he does so.&#8221; They asked him and he said, &#8220;I do so because it mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer).&#8221; The Prophet; said (to them), &#8220;Tell him that Allah loves him.&#8221;

Also prophet (ﷺ) narrates that

Hence having the knowledge of the names of Allah is utterly beneficial to the believer to gain love of his Lord and ultimately attaining Jannah.

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    <strong>Allah would be worshiped with Ihsan<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></strong>
  </li>
</ol>

It is only with proper knowledge of Allah ta’laa that one learns how to pray to Him with Ihsan, concentration and full submission. The knowledge of it can be gained through learning the attributes of Allah & affirming His Oneness. To know that He is All-Hearing and All- Seeing will fill your heart with love, fear and awe while in prayer.

In conclusion, to gain the success of this world and the hereafter, to be sincere in one’s actions with love and pleasure of Allah and to worship Him with full submission, the knowledge of Tawheed is undoubtedly essential. This in sha Allah will eventually save one from the wrath of Allah and enter us to Jannah.
