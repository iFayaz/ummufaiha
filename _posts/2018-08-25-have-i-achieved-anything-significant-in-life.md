Assalaamu alaikum dear ones.

has it been long without a post? 🙈oh yes, sorry!

It&#8217;s been hectic. Kids, work, kitchen and my own tantrums at life. Haha.

Anyways, I was pondering over something the other day. And would like to share it with you all.

It all started when I saw the graduation photos of some of my friends (who are a lot younger than me) from law school. The feeling of not having achieved anything significant in life kinda strike-d me at that moment. There was this deep pain inside the heart which devalued myself in my own eyes.

I clearly remember what my 12th grade math teacher told me. He told me that, when he meets me next, I will be married, with 4 children, and specifically with NO DEGREE. May be he was right. At 26 years old, I’m married with two children. And of corse with NO degree. May be his words might come true. However, I haven&#8217;t met him yet. 😂

I have seen my classmates achieve higher aims. I have seen them with Diplomas, Degrees and masha Allah even with Masters in their fields. I am happy for them. From the bottom of my heart. May Allah give them more success. If so, why this much guilt??

The thing is that, I have been labeled as the one &#8216;without any qualification&#8217; at work place, at workshops by co workers and so many other people.

Is it because of the above mentioned reasons I belittle myself at times.

or is it truly because I still haven&#8217;t achieved my academic goals yet??

Or should I consider a blessed marriage with two children a goal I have achieved!?

I remember the verse in surah Ar-Rahman (one of my fav surah)

فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ

> So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?

It is here that I stop thinking that I haven&#8217;t achieved anything.

It is when I start thinking about those hundreds of people without a spouse or children.

It makes me contemplate on how happy I actually am. I have kind hearted friends. A supportive family and many other people who look up for me. And they don&#8217;t belittle me for not having a degree, they love me as who I am. They ask me for suggestions and actually take them. I advice them, and they listen.

And then I completely forget about my &#8216;unachieved academic goals&#8217;. Not that having academic goals is bad, or not useful, but concentrating on what you do best and what you have already achieved is much more valuable.

Hence, be proud of your accomplishments, and know that some dreams are better kept as dreams so that you would never stop dreaming.

And also, be grateful for what Allah has already granted you, but never stop making dua to Him.

May Allah be with you all.

Much Love
