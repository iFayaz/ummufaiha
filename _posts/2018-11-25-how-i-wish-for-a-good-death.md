It was a cold rainy morning. As I finished off with making breakfast, feeding the kids and sat down with my phone scrolling through Facebook, I came across a post by a sister. About signs of a good death.

I wasn&#8217;t even done reading the full post, tears filled my eyes, and my heart ached deeply. I kept on contemplating if I deserve a good death. I kept on thinking about how I would love to die while on sujood. Or reciting Quran. I wondered about how I would like to meet my Lord.

But then this ayah made me see the bigger picture.

كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ ۗ وَنَبْلُوكُم بِالشَّرِّ وَالْخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً ۖ وَإِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ

Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.

(Quran; 21:35)

Although we all desire a good death, it would not be that easy to attain it. We will surely be tested. With evil, good and trials.

So this means, to attain a good death, we should understand how Allah will test us.

For example, take children. They are a true blessing from Allah. When we bring them up in the proper Islamic way, nurture them with discipline and kindness, they could be our direct ticket to Jannah. But our negligence in this could also make us be among the wrongdoers.

Let&#8217;s take sickness for another example. Being sick is not easy. It is one of the hardest of trials at times. But if we were to be patient during it, and seek forgiveness from Allah and hope for a cure from Him, it might be the best of your deeds. And sickness could also act as a barrier between you and your sins.

So let&#8217;s make our limited days here worth it. Start our day with azkaar, do not miss a single prayer. Do the sunnah prayers as much as you can. Make dua for a good death.

May Allah bestow all of us with a good ending. Aameen
