**It&#8217;s been almost 7 years now. I think I better start talking about it**. But it&#8217;s never gonna be easy though.

I still remember that day when my husband and I saw the &#8216;postive&#8217; pregancy test results at the hospital. We both freaked out. It was hardly after a month we got married. We had just started working in anew place. A new island. We weren&#8217;t just ready. I wasn&#8217;t ready. I had plans. I wanted to study business studies. Wanted to become a business woman.

But all the dreams and hopes came crushing down right in front of my eyes, with the simple &#8216;postive&#8217; sign on a paper.

We both discussed and discussed. On what stand to take. May be we both didn&#8217;t want a baby back then.

But then I don&#8217;t even know when my mother instincts woke up. I totally fell in love with my growing belly. I started searching and researching about pregnancies. I kept my phone&#8217;s special application on pregnancy updated each day. Ah. What a joy it was. To guess the gender based on my mood swings and foods I craved.

Three months passed, I was happy as I could ever be. I had this little tiny belly. And each scan or visit to the hospital was utter happiness for me.

Finally came the fourth month, I was the most excited when the doctor told me that the baby would move during that month. I remember making my husband wait in the middle of the road while on our way to work, just because I felt like the baby moved or kicked. Silly me.

Then one day, the clear blue sky tinted grey for me. I took a bath was chilling at home, when I started getting a little backache. I ignored it thinking it&#8217;s all normal during the pregnancy. But the pain getting more intense, up until I couldnt stand or lay down. I called my husband and my mother. We called the local midwife, but she told there&#8217;s nothing she can do for me since I was only 3+ months pregnant. Then I called my sister who explained me that I was actually having an abortion. And the backpain was the contractions.

We had to travel back to the regional hospital located in another island. When we got there, the pain has gotten so intense that I could no longer bear it. A female gynecologist attended my case, and her clear answer was stab in my heart. &#8216;we can&#8217;t save the baby, you are having a spontaneous abortion.&#8217;

I didn&#8217;t know how to react, I felt numb. I spend long three hours in the room. The nurses were asked not to touch the baby because it was too fragile. I just saw him once. But I cherish the moment forver. I saw the little handsome man, all curled up in a kidney tray. Just once. I was transferred to the gynae ward. Where mothers who gave birth were admitted with their babies. I cried non-stop. Each time I heard a baby cry or saw a mother feeding a baby, my heart just broke into pieces. I couldn&#8217;t watch it. I requested the doctor to discharge me. And she understood. We stayed in the island over night.

I sobbed and sobbed. I never knew, I would miss being pregnant this much. I wanted to feel the baby move inside my belly. I wanted to hug him, kiss him. I wanted to hold him for onwxw.
