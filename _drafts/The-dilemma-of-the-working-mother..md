I have heard and read a lot about the dilemmas of mothers. And have always agreed with the fact that &#8216;the working mother&#8217; spends less time with the child thing. Yeah yeah. &#8216;It&#8217;s so easy for you guys&#8217; comments have always been flushed right away from my toilet.

But today, I&#8217;m gonna bring feces back. Yes. Because it&#8217;s hard. Because your comments are hurtful. Because you don&#8217;t know.

So, respectfully let&#8217;s start this argumentation.

Waking up early in the morning, is not easy. Not for mothers. (Working outside the home or anywhere). However, I wake up, &#8216;almost&#8217; take a bath, wake the children up get them ready for school. Oh yes, I do give them breakfast, but I skip it; I just have to. Or else, I&#8217;ll get late.

I go to work (I work in a school), fetch the kid with me to school. So the &#8216;hungry from minute one of waking up mom&#8217; is hyped by mid noon. The tension of work. The tantrums of the kid. The &#8216;left over work&#8217; at home in my mind.

I come home tired. Baths the kids. Feed them lunch, I sometimes do eat from their plate though. Tuck the younger kid for a nap, that&#8217;s of course after some 120 minutes of tantrums, story listening, playing and watching a &#8216;under-aged&#8217; video with him.

Some days, I&#8217;m lucky enough to get some 30 minutes of nap time. But whenever I do, I almost miss a Quran class which my 6 year old has to attend or waste an hour of teaching her alphabets or the extra help she has to be given at home. So taking a nap has always made me feel guilty or selfish.

In the evening, I take kids out. But sometimes I just don&#8217;t. Because apparently the tired mom just can&#8217;t.
